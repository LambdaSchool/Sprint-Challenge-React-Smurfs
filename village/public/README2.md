So AJAX libraries are just ways of receiving and passing data? Do they have any design capability like CSS or SASS?

So Fetch API and Axios are now the most modern and popular tools for AJAX libraries ? Are these the packages we discussed? 

If I wanted to design my own package where would I start? 

So you were saying do not install packages gloabally install as per project so that each has it's own eco-system, which do you recommend installing globally in your opinion? 

Can you explain a little more on the concept of CRUD to me?
