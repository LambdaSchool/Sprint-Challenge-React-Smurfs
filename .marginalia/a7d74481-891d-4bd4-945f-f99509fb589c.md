// CORS is a node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a W3C spec that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.  CORS is used to get around the browsers same-origin policy. For security purposes, a browser won't load requests for resources to other domains when those requests are initiated by scripts.
