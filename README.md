<!-- # Assessing your Routing/AJAX Fu

* The purpose of this exercise is to get you used to being quizzed on _Interview Questions_ commonly asked about Client Side Routing and making AJAX requests from a React application.
* Answers to your written questions will be recorded in _Answers.md_
* This is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can _reference_ any old code you may have, and the React Documentation, however, please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something.
* **Just a friendly Reminder** Don't fret or get anxious about this, this is a no-pressure assessment that is only going to help guide you here in the near future. This is NOT a pass/fail situation.

## Start by forking and cloning this repository.
## Questions - Self Study - You can exercise your Google-Fu for this and any other _Sprint Challenge_ in the future.

1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
1. What does HTTP stand for? 
1. What does CRUD stand for? 
1. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
1. Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests. -->

## Initializing Project - READ THIS CAREFULLY, you have two apps here. A server, and a client.

* Start by Forking and Cloning this Repo.
* `cd` into the forked copy.
* _RUN_ `npm install` to retrieve all the dependancies.
* _LOOK_ at all the files you've been given for this project. One important file to note is `server.js`. This file contains an **API** that you are going to be interfacing with. Below is documentation on how to interact with the **API**.
* _RUN_ `npm start` to get your API up and running on `http://localhost:3333`. This is the **URL** you're going to need to use within your React app in order to make AJAX requests for data.
* After your API is up and running, you can open chrome and type in `http://localhost:3333/smurfs`. You should see an empty Array `[]` returned to you. This is an array that your **API** will be using to store our Smurf Data.
* _LOOK_ at your `village` directory and notice it's just a plain ol' React App that we've built using `create-react-app`.
* _cd_ into `village` and run `npm install` to retreive the client side dependencies.
* _RUN_ `npm start` to fire up your React application, you should see an error that reads: `TypeError: Cannot read property 'smurfs' of null`.

## Project Description

* For this challenge you're going to fix all errors and finish the application.
* The requirements for completion are that you are using AXIOS to `GET` a list of Smurfs that exist on the server && a `POST` to create a new Smurf and save it to the Smurf DB.
* If you get both of those two requirements finished early. Proceed to the **STRETCH PROBLEM** to try and implement a `PUT` and a `DELETE`.

## API Design - This is how you'll interface with the API and what is required from every endpoint.

### GET '/smurfs'

* To retreive an array all the smurfs in the Smurf DB simply write a get to the endpoint `'/smurfs'`

### POST '/smurfs'

* To add a smurf to the Smurf DB you'll need all three fields.
* Example:

```
{
  name: 'Brainey',
  age: 200,
  height: '5cm'
}
```

* If a smurf is created correctly, you should see a response that is an array of smurfs with uniqe id's assigned to each smurf.
* **HINT** if you are going to be working on Extra Credit, you'll need to use that unique `id`.
* Example of object created in Smurf DB:

```
[
    {
        "name": "Brainey",
        "age": 200,
        "height": "5cm",
        "id": 0
    },
    {
        "name": "Sleepy",
        "age": 200,
        "height": "5cm",
        "id": 1
    }
]
```

<!-- ## STRETCH PROBLEM - Extra Credit!

* The following two endpoints are here for you if you'd like to push yourselves a little further.
  ### PUT '/smurfs/123', where 123 is the Id of the smurf you want to modify
* For this endpoint to work, you'll need an `id` added to the URL, and at least one field to update on the Smurf object. `name` `age` `height`.
* Example:

```
input:
{
  id: 1,
  name: Sleepy
}
output:
{
  name: 'Sleepy',
  age: 30,
  height: '3cm,
  id: 1
}
```

### DELETE '/smurfs/123', where 123 is the Id of the smurf you want to remove

* For this endpoint to work, all you need is an id sent up as part of the request url.

* If your delete worked, you'll get a success object back.
* Example:

```
output:
{
    "SmurfRemoved": {
        "name": "Sleepy",
        "age": 200,
        "height": "5cm",
        "id": 1
    }
}
``` -->
