1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

Server-side routing re-renders an entire html page when a link is clicked.  This often makes webpages slow to load, consumes unneeded bandwidth, and eats up memory.

Client-side routing is used with single page applications and prevents the entire page from re-rendering. Instead only the changed component is re-rendered leading to slower initial load times, but a lightening fast app.
