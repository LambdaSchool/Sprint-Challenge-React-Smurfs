1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side routing allows the entire page to be stored within the application's memory which allows for routing to be 
faster because less memory is being processed, and the browser doesn't need to refresh because the server isn't compiling the page.
This also allows for smoother transitions and animations.The initial loading time of the application may take longer because the whole
site needs to load initially.

Server-side routing only requests the needed data and won't store the extra. Server-side routing is SEO friendly but the browser must reload to render a new page and this rerouting within the app will take longer because the data isn't already available.
