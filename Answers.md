# Questions - Self Study - You can exercise your Google-Fu for this and any other _Sprint Challenge_ in the future.

#### Q1. Describe the concept of a "Single Source of Truth" in Redux. Ex. What is the difference between Redux/Application _State_ vs. React/Component _State_?
--A1: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. I'm really not comprehending any further than that at the moment.

#### Q2. Describe what an _Action_ is/does.
--A2: An action will call the functions in the reducers (according to them internets)

#### Q3. Describe what a _Reducer_ is/does.
--A3: The name "reducer" trips me up a lot. They're component classes, I believe, but they get a special name because: ? ?  So I think perhaps it's to do with the state changes, like maybe the reduction is happening from all these different state changes in history like the back button history on a browser, and you can right click it and "reduce" it down to one cross section in time? I'm really not sure. I'd love a clean description from you when you read this please   :)  I believe the reducers are the ones that actually change the data. 

#### Q4. What does HTTP stand for? 
--A4: The initialism "HTTP" stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. 

#### Q5. What does CRUD stand for? 

--A5: The acronym "CRUD" stands for create, read, update and delete. These are the four basic functions of persistent storage. 

#### 06. Describe four HTTP methods that can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use to interface with APIs/Servers.

--A6: I mean, it's just crud again, right? Or am I missing something? Hah. This is cool tho, I'm finding all these different variations like BREAD, MADS, CHAS, DAVE, CRAP, VEND, DOUG, and it has me all excited to be better at this tuff so i can actually start utilizing all this badass knowledge!  :)
