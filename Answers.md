1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Client-side routing is routing that is done from the "client" or within the
    browser. All of the different routes to the varius webpages are loaded once
    from the server and then linked from within the browser. Server side routing
    keeps all of the pages/routes on the server and sends them to the browser
    when they're requested by the client.
