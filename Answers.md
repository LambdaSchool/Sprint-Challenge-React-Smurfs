1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

In server-side routing, there is a page reload everytime a request is made from client to server (i.e., load, refresh, interacting with a button, creating, deleting something on the page). Everything gets loaded, up front (aka front loading), only component that are needed, get reloaded, not the entire thing. This is a faster user experience on initial load.

In client-side routing, everything gets loaded, so it's a slower user experience, on initial load. But once the page is loaded, it won't refresh everytime a user interacts with it. This is possible through React and Component-Based 'React Way' architecture.
