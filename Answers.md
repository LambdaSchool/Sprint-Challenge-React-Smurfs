1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    server-side routing is, when a link is clicked a request is made for a new page, which is the old way of handling a request before AJAX, where every 
    request will end up with the whole page being reloaded.
    client-side routing is when the request is made is handeled internally by the javascript on the page giving us single page application. Only the component 
    that needs to reloaded is reloaded.
