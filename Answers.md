1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side Routing - requires communication to the server for all website events like onClick() which causes the page to refresh in all of these instances
Client-side Routing - requires communication to the server in less frequency. Majority of information on the initial load of the website shall contain state which hold all of the neccessary information inorder to process events without requiring communication with the server which ultimately causes the website to not refresh. But small requests can be requested for updating information using AJAX witch will also not require a page refresh.
