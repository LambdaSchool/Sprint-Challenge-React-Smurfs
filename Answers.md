1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-Side Routing (Standard)

Needs to refresh with every new request. The information requested is the will be the only information given.  This can make things slow if a lot of information Is being requested. 

Client-Side Routing 

Routing handled internally by the JS that is already on the page.  This is the modern way of routing. No refreshing at all and will display data on the drop of a dime because it is already stored. 

Main difference is that server-side requires refresh/reload and Client side doesn't.
