**1.** The differences between client and server side routing have to do with how page refreshes are handled. On a client side request the entire page is refreshed whereas in a server side routed application the route is determined on the user's computer via Javascript already on the page. Changes in url will only update the part of the page that is needed and not necessiate an entire page refresh. 

**2.** HTTP is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

**3.** CRUD means " Create, Read, Update, Delete". Ruby is great for getting simple CRUD apps up and running quickly.

**4.** Create = POST
   Read = GET
   Update = PUT
   Delete = DELETE
   
**5.** Three tools we can use to make AJAX requests are FETCH, AXIOS and REST.
