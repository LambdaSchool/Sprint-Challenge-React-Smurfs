1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    With server-side routing, everything is done on the server. when information is requested, the server sends back a bunch of DOM elements and refresh the whole web page to display them. Whereas client-side routing, JavaScript allows State or memory within the applications to be maintained, and that memory tells the browser what to display when a resource is requestd. the data is there, only displayed when asked for, and the page would not refresh.
