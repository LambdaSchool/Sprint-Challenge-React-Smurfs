## 1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side rendering displays information onto the screen from a web server with the intact HTML in all its glory served straight from the server or world wide web. Once on your local computer it has to send and request data back and forth  out across the word wide web when navigating or making changes to the page. 
Client-side rendering is using local JavaScript files that are sent to your local browser to function with the application as you navigate through the page. This method is much faster and more efficient in the ever  growing complexities of our online environment. This is possible because of languages like React.js that allow local components to implement dynamic functionality while still communicating with the server data base if need be. 
## 2.  What does HTTP stand for?
HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol.
## 3.  What does CRUD stand for?

## 4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
HTTP methods mapped to CRUD are POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE(C:Post, R:Get, U:Put/Patch, D:Delete).
## 5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.
