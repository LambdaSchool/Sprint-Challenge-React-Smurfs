Questions:

1.  Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

1.  Client-side-routing happens when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page. 
    When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but the request to the server is prevented. The whole page won't
		refresh when using client-side routing.
		A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh. This is because a new GET request is sent to the server which responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page altogether.
