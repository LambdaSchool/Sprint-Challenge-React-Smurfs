1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.  
    Client-side routing is when JavaScript handles routing on your browser. This allows us to navigate without having to refresh a page or download the same data from a server.  
    Server-side routing is when the server handles routing. Every time you click on a link, your browser will request a new page from the server and the page will be refreshed.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?  
    HTTP is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is a way of communicating between a browser and a server. The browser makes a request and the server provides a response.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?  
    CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.  
    Create: POST  
    Read: GET  
    Update: PUT  
    Delete: DELETE

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
