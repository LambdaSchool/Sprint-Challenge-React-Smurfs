1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client side routing is when data flow between the user and a website is handled internally by the Javascript that is being loaded on the page. Server-side routing has data going to a server and back with every user interaction. Server side routing results in a full page refresh for every interaction while client side routing may result in an initial longer loading time because all of the data gets sent in the initial request. 

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is the system for how the messages are formatted and transmitted through the internet and the browser's/server's response to these requests. 

3.  What does CRUD stand for?
C - Create (make something on a page)
R - Read (access something on a page)
U - Update (update something on a page)
D - Delete

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
C(reate) = POST
R(read) = GET
U(pdate) = PUT
D(elete) = DELETE

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
We saw Postman being used to make requests which is a software that does it for us. We also used Axios (a library) to make these requests. We also saw fetch (a web API) being used to make AJAX requests during our initial demos in the training kit.
