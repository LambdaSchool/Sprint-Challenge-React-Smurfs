1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    The differences between client-side routing and server-side routing is through several indicators. While there are minor differences, such as SEOs being more optimal through server side routing, server side routing's biggest difference from client-side routing is that it only requests specific requests that are needed, but results in a full page refresh when a request is made. This can be particularly problematic for individuals who are using server-side routing on 3G mobile devices or slower internet connections. Client-side routing has a slower initial load time than a server-side app, but but loads faster between routing since data is processed internally. Client-side also has easier views between animations and transitions.
