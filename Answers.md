1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Answer: server-side routing entails having all the necessary data for your application stored on a server, which then sends new data every time its requested from the client in the form of an entire html document. The drawback is that this results in a full page refresh, and can be slow because of the amount of info being requested. client-side routing on the other hand involves the handling of routes between views of the website internally within the client.
