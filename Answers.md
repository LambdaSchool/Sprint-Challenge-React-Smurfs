1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
In server-side routing every time you navigate to a new URL the a request is made to the server and the server sends new HTML to your browser, causing longer load times between pages on a webpage.

In client-side routing, the first time you navigate to a webpage almost all of the data from the server is sent to the client, and as user navigates around the site they then have access to that data, and if they need more data from the server, only what is specifically needed gets sent back to the user in string and then it gets parsed into JSON, resulting in much faster, sometimes immediate, navigation from page to page within a single website/web application.
