1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client-side routing loads the entire website on initial load, then routes the user quickly as all the data for all routes in the site have already been recieved.  "Quickly" means we don't need to wait for a response from a server to open a comment/ link/ page - anything in the site. Pro- fast naviation. Con- slower initial load.
 Server-side routing sends requests to a server for each page, because it's only loading what's requested by the user, the initial load is faster, but the navigation through the sites pages are  slower.
