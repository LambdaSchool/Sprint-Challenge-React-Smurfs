Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.
    With server-side routing the entire page is rendered every time a user interacts with the page.
    With client-side routing the UI is only updated where the change needs to occur so it takes less time, the page seems more responsive because it's so quick.

What does HTTP stand for?
    HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
What does CRUD stand for?

    CRUD are HTTP resource methods:
    'C' Creates date and refers to POST which requires a request BODY object.
    'R' Reads data from a server and refers to GET which doesn't request BODY
    'U' Updates information refers to PUT which request a BODY
    'D" Delete or Remove and refers to DELTE which requires BODY object.

Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    I'm a bit unsure about this, have to read more but I believe PUT and POST.
Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.
    Axios, JQuery and rails=ujs (no JQuery).
