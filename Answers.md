1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

With server side routing, every time you go to a new URL, the entire page is refreshed on the server. However with client side routing, less data and only what is requested will be processed. Because of this, routing across an app in client side routing is usually quicker. Another main difference is that server side routing has been the standard for a long time, so as a result, SEO is more leaned towards apps that use server side routing rather than client side routing.
