1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
1.  What does HTTP stand for?
1.  What does CRUD stand for?
1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
1.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests


1. With the client-side-routing browser page dosen't get refreshed, so we can surf between pages super smooth like a butter and fast like 'Fast and Furious'. 
When we get responses from the server, the page reloads, so it might take some time.

//Up to this point not googling monsieur Kamal.

2. But HTTP definition isn't stuck in my head, so I'll bing it if you don't mind Kamal. 

Not sure if it is right answer, but HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. And this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted in the World Wide Web. 

3. Another binged answer. 
Not sure what it is, but CRUD is something about 'Create', 'Read', 'Update', 'Delete'.

4. Not sure...let's bing this too. 

Bing says PUT and POST, but everything that I'm reading rn looks like latin to me. 

5. Not sure, but my heart tell me that these are 'Get', 'Post' and 'Put'.
