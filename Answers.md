1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.
Server side routing is the older and more traditional page of handling webpages. Where the client makes a request to the page and the server provides page info back to it. However, this can be tedious since the page has to be reloaded each tiem.

Client-side routing is where when the client requests a change on the page, instead of sending it to the server for a new page, it simply changes the contents on the page to match what the user needed.
