1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

Client-side routing serves URL links internally on the client browser which means on the initial download the whole web application is downloaded. Server-side routing makes a request to the server every time a user of the web application/page clicks/requests a new URL. In this case, a new web page renders to the client browser with every new request.
