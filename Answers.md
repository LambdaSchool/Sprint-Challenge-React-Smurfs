1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side routing will only request whatever data is needed for each page but every subsequent request will refresh the whole page including any elements that remained the same between requests. Client-side routing will have a longer intital load time because it requests more data than is displayed on the intital page, but navigation afterwards is much more responsive and it doesn't have to reload common elements.
