Below are my answers to the Sprint Challenge Questions.

### 1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client-side routing initially downloads a larger file from the server but afterwards, all of the pages visited are already on the client and it can simulate a speedier site.

Server-side routing is a little more "traditional" and all of the page requests are sent through the server with each page being downloaded seperately. 

### 2.  What does HTTP stand for?
H = Hyper
T = Text
T = Transfer
P = Protocol

### 3.  What does CRUD stand for?
C = Create
R = Read
U = Update
D = Delete

### 4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
Create = PUT (to a New url)
Read = GET
Update = PUT (to an existing url)
Delete = DELETE

#### 5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
I want to say that they are called:
    *Async
    *Callback
    *Promise

But, if I'm completely honest, I'm still working on grasping that.
