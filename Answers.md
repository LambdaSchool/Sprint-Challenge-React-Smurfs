1. Client side routing is when the routing is done on the users computer as opposed to on a server. Unfortunately I don't think I can give a more indepth answer. I'll have to do some reading on it this weekend.
2. Hypertext Transfer Protocol
3. I don't recall ever hearing this acronym during class, but google has informed me that it stands for Create Read Update Delete. It must be important if it's being asked here, so I guess that's another thing I'll be reading up on this weeked.
4. Get, Post , Put and Delete. This is mostly a guess since I'm not at all familiar with the CRUD acronym.
5. I've read the preclass reading on AJAX(the MDN doc), I don't really understand what it is or how it realtes to what we've been doing.
