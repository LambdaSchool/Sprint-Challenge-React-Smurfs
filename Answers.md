1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
> **Client-side routing** is when a user is able to go from page to page without having to ask the server to respond with the data/information before the new page can be displayed. This is typically a faster response because we do not need to wait for the server to respond. While faster this will typically have negative affects to the websites SEO but there are ways to get around this.

> **Server-side routing** is the opposite of client-side routing. Everytime a user requests a new page the website must ask the server if it knows if this file exists. If the server is able to find the file it will then send the information back to the client and will then render in the browser. This is the older, original, form of routing that is still used in many modern websites.
