1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

A: Client-side routing is used for SPAs and runs in the browser, is faster and smoother in changes because less data is being requested due to the fact that the entire application/website must load upfront on the first request, which causes a slow load-time. The  Server-Side routing comes from the server, asks only for the requested data but refreshes the entire page when data is requested which can be a back-breaker on rendering time.

A: Hypertext Transfer Protocol.


3.  What does CRUD stand for?

A: Create, Read, Update, Delete.


4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers?

A: If I'm understanding the question correctly, this:  POST (Creates new resource), GET (Retrieves the resource), PUT (Updates an already existing resource), DELETE (Deletes the resource).
