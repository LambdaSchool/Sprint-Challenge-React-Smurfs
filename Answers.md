1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client side routing uses JavaScript loaded by the client to handle changes in the url path. 
- Client side requires all data to be frontloaded but is much faster during browsing.

Server-side routing handles changes in the url path with a server side language (ASP, PHP) to return the requested data.
-Server-side isn't front loaded so initial load times are faster but it's slower during browsing as new data is loaded.
