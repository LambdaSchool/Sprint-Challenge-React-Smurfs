1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    'Client-side routing' is when the app is loaded fully on the initial loading of the page so that there doesn't need to be server requests from a server to fetch further information for page loads like 'server-side routing'. Essentially there aren't any page refreshes to get data. However at times there may be a need to fetch more data from the server in terms of an AJAX request.
