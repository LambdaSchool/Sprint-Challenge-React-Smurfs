1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Historically the web has relied on server-side routing, where a client, like a browser, make a request to a server for any type of information it needs when navigating a web page. This information could be in regards to front end UI or database queries. The main difference between server side and client side routing is that in server side routing, all of theses requests for information need to go back to the server, get the information, and return to the client where a whole page refresh occurs, discarding all of the old information there. In client side routing, however, we make one request to the server and get all of the information at once, and any request that would have gone to the server is handled locally by javascript to change the URL of the page, and serve up the requested info. A whole page refresh is not necessary in client side routing and thus can have much better performance while navigating. It is good to note however, that initial load times may be a bit slower for client side routing, as we need to get all of the information (potentially info we won't use) at once.
1.  What does HTTP stand for?
    HTTP stand for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, and is the set of rules that the web follows, or the protocol that the web uses to facilitate communication through web requests and responses. It dictates how information will be split up into packages, what to do when conflicting GET or POSt requests come in, and how entities on the internet are connected, amongst other things. 
1.  What does CRUD stand for?
    CRUD stands for Create Read Update and Delete. This acronym is a good reminder of the basic functionality an API should have, and is also a good way to separate concerns when building something that takes in, manipulates and returns data.  
1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    The methods in CRUD are commonly associated with the HTTP methods Post, Get, Put, and delete. Post being to create information, Get being to retrieve and display the data, Put being to alter an existing record
1.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
    I know of two tools which are commonly used, which are promises and callback functions. promises are objects with certain methods and attributes which make them perfect for waiting for information before executing a function. Nested callbacks can also be used, but are cumbersome in their application.
