1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
-- Client-side routing enacts a full refresh of the page, whereas server-side routing only refreshes the part of the page that is being requested. However, this means that the whole page has to be loaded in the beginning, making initial loading times longer than server-side routing.

1.  What does HTTP stand for?
-- HTTP === HyperText Transport Protocol; it is a set of rules that servers and clients use to transport data between each other.

1.  What does CRUD stand for?
-- CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Destroy; these are the actions that take place in HTTP when clients and servers speak with each other.

1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
-- Create == Post; Read == Get; Update == Put; Delete == Delete;
