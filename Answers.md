1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
The difference is that for server-side routing, the whole page is refreshed on a get request, which is slow for large documents or for those with slow internet speeds. Less data is processed for client-side routing. However, the initial load for client-side routing is longer because the whole website needs to be loaded. It also requires more code than server-side routing.
