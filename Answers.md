1.  Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

* Server side routing is where when a link is clicked, a request goes to the code on the server, and a whole new page is reloaded. Client side routing is handled on the page, by javascript with no server side request; this means that just the necessary state is updated, not the entire page. Client side is reactive.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

* HyperText Transfer Protocol.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

* Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

* POST, GET, PUT, DELETE.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.

* Axios, fetch, request.
