1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side routing: Only what is needed for a specific request is sent to the browser. If you want to go to a new page in the same website, a new request has to be made. Quicker initial load time.

    Client-side routing: Everything is sent to the browser with the inital request. A new request is not made to switch between pages. Longer initial load time, but very fast when moving between pages.
