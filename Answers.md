1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
React uses client-side routing.  Rather than reloading from an external server each time a change is made, client-side routing locally only changes the part of the UI that has changed, rather than reloading the entire page.

Server-side routing is the more 'old school' approach to routing.  Every time a page needs updating, a request is made to an external server and the entire page reloads with the updated UI.
