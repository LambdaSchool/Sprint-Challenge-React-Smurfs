1 - The single source of truth concept means the state of the entire applciation is stored in a single store. A 
react state stores data locally within a component. When it needs to share with other component, it is passed
through props. With redux the state is stored globally, where any component can access it. 
2 - Actions send data from the application to the store.
3 - A reducer updates the application state based on the action.
4 - HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
Four methods that we can map to the CRUD acronym are post, which creates a resource on the server; get, which pulls 
information from the server; patch, which updates a portion of the resource; delete, which removes a resource from 
a server.
