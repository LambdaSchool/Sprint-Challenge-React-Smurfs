1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
-server side routing is whenever you click on something (like a link) that changes the url, that request will go to the server to make the changes (and refresh the page). Client side routing means the routing/data is handled on browser using javascript to hold and call the data whenever something (like that link mentioned above) is clicked, and because of this, we don't need to refresh the page.
