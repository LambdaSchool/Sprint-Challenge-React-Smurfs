1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
  Server side routing is what we have typically used with web sites from the beginning. The client sends a request to the server, then the server determines what data needs sent & sends back to the client. For client-side-routing, everything is sent to the client on the initial load. From there, the client can navigate around without the need for making server requests.
