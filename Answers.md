1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.
   * With server-side routing the page is reloaded whenever a get request is triggered. 
   * With client-side routing there is no page refresh as no get requests are made.
   * An application using client-side routing takes longer to download as it has higher 
     overhead, but with this comes the benefit of faster loads as page refreshes are prevented.
2. What does HTTP stand for?
   * Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
3. What does CRUD stand for?
   * Create, Read, Update, Delete
4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
5. Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.
