**1.** The differences between client-side-routing and server-side-routing are that with server-side-routing, a new page is requested from an external server and this new document is served to the user. A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh because a new GET request is sent to the server. With client-side-routing, the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page. A URL on the page will result in a changed state of the applcication as opposed to an entire new webpage. The whole page will not refresh this way.

**2.** HTTP stands for "Hyper Text Transfer Protocol"

**3.** CRUD stands for "Create, Read, Update, Delete"

**4.** The HTTP methods that can be mapped to the CRUD acronymt hat we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers are as follows:

* Create == POST
* Read == GET
* Update == PUT/PATCH
* Create == DELETE

**5.** Three tools that we can use to make AJAX requests are REST, XMLHttpRequest, and Axios.
