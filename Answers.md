1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-Side Routing
Traditionally pages were formed on the server and delivered whole. You only recieved the data for the page you were on - no more, no less. The problem with that is a large amount of data you download between pages, like your header and footer, is redundant and shouldn't need to be downloaded again.
Client-Side Routing
With client-side routing you download a good portion of the data for your whole site up front and then JavaScript in your browser switches between pages. This does mean a longer time up front to view you page, but very fast switching between the pages on your site.
