1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
        Client side Routing is handled internally, adjustment of the URL will result in a changed state of the SPA, and the page will not need to refresh to display changes.
        In server side routing it is necessary for the whole page to refresh because we recieve and entirely new document from the server when we send a get request.
