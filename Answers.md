1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing is when you request information form a server and the server returns a new document all together and disregarding the old one, every request results in a full-page refresh.  Client side routing is when the route is handled internally by the javascript that is loaded on the page.  When a request is made, the whole page will not refresh, it will only update the data it needs to.
