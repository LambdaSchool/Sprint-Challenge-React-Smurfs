1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

- For Server Side Routing, the webpage will only request the data that is needed. However whenever you make ia request on the website it will perfomr a complete page refresh, this results in longer loading times when moving between different pages on the website.

- For Client Side Routing, the webpage will do one initial request and gather all data. This will result in a slower initial loading time but navigation between pages will be extremely fast. Sometimes however with client side routing you will load data that you will have no use for.
