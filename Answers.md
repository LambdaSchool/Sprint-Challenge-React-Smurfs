1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client-side routing happens internally, so that when a user clicks on a link, a request to a server is prevented. The state is changed, meaning a user views a new component (the page does not refresh).

Server-side routing happens when a new Get request is sent to the server which responds with a new document (new page) that is served to the user.
