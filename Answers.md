1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

> A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh. This is because a new GET request is sent to the server which responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page altogether. The whole page wonâ€™t refresh when using client-side routing. There are just some elements inside the application that will change.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

> Hypertext Transfer Protocol

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

> Create, read, update and delete

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

> | HTTP Method | CRUD             |
> | ----------- | ---------------- |
> | POST        | Create           |
> | GET         | Read             |
> | PUT         | Update (Replace) |
> | PATCH       | Update (Modify)  |
> | DELETE      | Delete           |
