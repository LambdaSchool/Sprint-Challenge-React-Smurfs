1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-Side Routing loads all the application's data ahead of time. This allows for smoother and quicker transitions between parts of that application. However, because all data is loaded, it takes a longer to initially start. Additionally, the user may not even access some of the data that is loaded, because they do not reach that part of the website or other application. 

Server Side Routing is when data is retrieved and placed only when a user needs to access that information. Some elements on the application are reloaded that may not need to be. Also, because the application reloads every time information is asked for, it is usually a slower process when viewing these kinds of applications.
