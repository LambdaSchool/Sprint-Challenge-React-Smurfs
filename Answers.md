1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

        reload more data.  Initially loading all of the data may load a bunch of unnecessary files.  Server side routing loads 
        only the need information intially.  This leads to a shorter initial load but then it needs to reload data everytime.
