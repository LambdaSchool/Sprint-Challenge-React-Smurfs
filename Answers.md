1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Client side routing is the use of JavaScript on the client to control routing. This usually involves
    hijacking part of the URL bars functionality.  This allows quicker switching between pages.

    Server side routing is when the server handles routing and returns information based off the URL.
    This means that every single request you have to download stuff from the server. Initial load times
    can be quicker.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

    You can use Ajax library such as  axios or jquery's Ajax library. You can also use the fetch API which is built into browsers.
    And last, and arguably the least enjoyable, you can use old school xhr requests which are also built into the browser's API.
