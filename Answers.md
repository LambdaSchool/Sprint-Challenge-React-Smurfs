1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
      A server-side routing is when the page gets refreshed when a user makes a request to a different page, so the page they where on gets discarded and the new page gets its information. Client-side routing does not refresh the page, instead it only changes some parts of the page based on the information needed from the server.
