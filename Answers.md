Describe the concept of a "Single Source of Truth" in Redux. Ex. What is the difference between Redux/Application State vs. React/Component State?
* In Redux, the state of the whole application is stored in an object tree in a single store.
* In React, different components manage separate states and pass them around as needed.

Describe what an Action is/does.
* An action is what sends the data from the application to the store. Actions are the only sources of information for the store.

Describe what a Reducer is/does.
* Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to the actions.
