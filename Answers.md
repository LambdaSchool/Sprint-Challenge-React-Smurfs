1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    In server-side routing a website is requested one page at a time from the server. Every time we navigte to a new page a new request to the server is made to get that page and causes the browswer to refresh. In client-side routing the bulk of the website or app is downloaded in the inital request and then AJAX calls are used to access the data the user is trying to view or use.
2.  What does HTTP stand for?
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
3.  What does CRUD stand for?
    Create, Read, Update, Delete.
4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    Create = POST request, Read = GET request, Update = PUT request, Delete = DELETE request.
5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
    Callback in JS aka "Callback Hell", Fetch API that comes with modern browsers, or Axios, a third-party library for making requests. Fetch and Axios utilize JavaScript Promises.
