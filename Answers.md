1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing occurs when a web page is coded in a way requires information to be retrieved from a server anytime the user interacts with a web page, thereby resulting in a full reload of that webpage, even if the section being reloaded is a small portion of that page. Client-side routing occurs when a a page's full functionality is downloaded from the server, and that page updates using the code that's already been loaded onto the user's machine, thereby reducing the need for data retrieval from the server and unnecessary page reloads.
