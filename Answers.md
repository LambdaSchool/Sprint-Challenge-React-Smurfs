1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
> * `server-side routing` - is a way of switching from one location to another by being routed to that new location by using an http request to a server.  This is the traditional way that the internet works as you go from one location to the next.
> * `client-side routing` - is a new way of routing that uses software built into the application that renders different components within an app by virtually routing the user from one virtual location to another virtual location. It is much faster than traditional `server-side routing` because there are fewer http requests involved.
