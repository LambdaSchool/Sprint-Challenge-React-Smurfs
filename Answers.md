1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
The Server side routing takes longer to load every single time the user sends a request to the server but the first load is faster than the client side routing. In the server side routin every time the users perform a request the server sends back an html in the client side routing the browser donwloads all the app at first and this make the first load longer but then all others loading time are super fast because the server doesn't return a HTML, just return some data in JSON format, also the page doesn't refreshes every time.
