1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.
   With client-side routing the entire web page is loaded initially, and changes in the URL are used to point to different components of the page. This makes for a slower intiial loading time, but faster changes once on the page. Server-side routing only requests the information needed at the moment and keeps the rest of it on the server. This makes initial loading faster but subsequent changes slower as some components that were already present are reloaded again.

2. What does HTTP stand for?
   HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It is the rule base underlying how information is transferred on the world wide web.

3. What does CRUD stand for?
   CRUD is an acronym for "create, read, update, delete." These are the main steps used in working with persistent storage and databases.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
   Post is the create method of HTTP, get is the read method, put is the update method (though sometimes create), and delete is the delete method.

5. Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.
   Three tools to make AJAX requests are jquery, using promises, and the fetch method.
