1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    The routing on the server-side-routing is handled by the server, thus each time a user navigate to a different path, the server will send new files for displaying a new page. On client-side routing, the routing is handled by the browser, thus the server sends all files needed in one go when the page first load and only receives AJAX requests after that.

    PUT => Update
    DELETE => Delete
