1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
A:   'client-side routing' is a more current / trending approach.  It initially grabs all of the info from the server which does take a bit longer to start, but then does all of the routing locally.  There are pros and cons to both approaches.  "Client-side routing" sacrifices some initial load time, but then performs much faster from then on.  Server-side is the opposite.  It will load faster initially, but every time you want to change pages within the app, you need to send a request to the server and then reload the page.
