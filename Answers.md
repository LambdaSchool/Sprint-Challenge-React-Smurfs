1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
   - Client side takes a bit longer initially as it loads the entire application and all data needed. Then relying on state changes to modify the components    of the application.

   - Server side is a faster initial load because you render only the information needed to represent a particular page, but the server must be queried and reloaded based on the response anytime there is a state change.
