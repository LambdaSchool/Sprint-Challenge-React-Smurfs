1. `server-side routing` is the old standard and involes making requests from the server for every url change. `client-side routing` is growing in popularity with the use of javascript frameworks and involves loading a single page which optionally displays data, allowing it to appear that pages are changing when, in fact, they are not refreshing or making requests from the server. This requires some additional load time on the first visit, but then, all subsequent clicks are fast and smooth.
2. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
3. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Varient names for the latter three are retrieve, modify, and destroy.
4. `Post`, `Get`, `Put`, `Delete`, respectively.
5. Perhaps the most common methods are `get`, `then`, and `catch`.
