1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side routing: search engines are optimized for them. Only the data that is requested is loaded. It has been standard for a long time. When the URL changes, information from the server is requested.
    Client-side routing: the intial load is longer because all the information is loaded at once. When the URL changes, the app changes state, therefore the information displaying changes, but no requests to the server are made and no refreshes happen.
