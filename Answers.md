1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
> Server-side routing is when the server returns a whole new html document everytime we make a request. Client-side routing is different in that it will handle the change internally without sending request to the server. The adjustment of url will determine how the state of the application change, resulting a different view of the webpage. If request needs to be sent to server, only the change for some data is requested, not the whole page.
