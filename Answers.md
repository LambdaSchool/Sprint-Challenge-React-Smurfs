1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    
    In server-side routing, all the html files and information of a website are stored on a server. If we click on a url, the client/browser will request the information from the server. Each event or action will always route to the server and in turn, the server sends back the information requested. This process can be slow. 	

	Client-side routing is a recent innovation in browsers. Modern browsers are now capable of maintaining state or memory. This means that they are capable of storing information. So when a user clicks on a url, the browser contacts the server then the server sends all the html files of the website and this is stored in state by the browser. This makes the browsing experience of the user more faster. 

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

    HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. This is a network protocol allowing servers, browsers, and devices to communicate with each other over the internet.   

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

    CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It corresponds to methods in Axios which are Post, Get, Put, and Delete.  

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

    The following are the HTTP methods that can be mapped to the CRUD acronym:                                        C (Create) for Post, R (Read) for Get, U (Update) for Put, D (Delete) for Delete. 

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

    AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javscript and XML. This is the ability of modern browsers to send and receive data in the background. This allows for data to be dynamic and the page doesn't need to always reload. This means a faster browsing experience. There are several tools available to work with AJAX. Three of these are: Google AJAX APA, Google Web Toolkit, and jQuery.
