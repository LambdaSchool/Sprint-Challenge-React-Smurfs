1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.
...The client side routing depends on the javascript and html to render the application or the website to add new content and server side routing reloads the new content from the browser itself to reveal the new content requested. The loading time for the server side is much longer than the client side but the client side only displays changes rendered and if the user wants to see the whole page of content not just the changes made, the load time in its initial stage can take long as well.

2. What does HTTP stand for?
...HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

3. What does CRUD stand for?

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

...Delete would go with Delete
