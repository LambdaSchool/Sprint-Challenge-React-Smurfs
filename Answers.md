1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

Server-side routing occurs when a new path of a url returns an entirely new page. Client-side routing uses javascript to deal with the change in url and only present the new data that was programmed to be there. One of the trade-offs is that client-side routing has much faster transitions between pages but requires more initial loading.
