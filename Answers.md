# Sprint Challenge--Routing-Axios

1. Routing is the mechanism by which requests are connected to the code and controls navigation through a site or application. A server-side request is sent to the server whcih responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page altogether. A client-side route happens when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page. Client-side routing is generally faster because it requires processing less data. 

2. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and refers to the primary technology protocol of the web that allows linking and browsing.

3. CRUD stands for create, retrieve, update and delete. Without all four of these functions, an application is not complete and will not function properly.

4. The four main HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST AND DELETE can be mapped to CRUD operations. GET retrieves the representation of the resource at a specified URI. GET should have no side efeects on the server. PUT uddates a resource at a specified URI. PUT can also be used to create a new resource at a specified URI, if the server allows clients to specify new URI's. POST creates a new resource. The server assigns the URI for the new object and returns this URI as part of the response message. DELETE deletes a resource at a specified URI. 

5. Some of the tools we use to make AJAX requests include HTML, JSON, JavaScript and DOM.
