1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

With server-side routing, we are fetching a completely new document from the server, causing the whole page to refresh and discard the old page altogether. Client-side routing strictly involves with the JavaScript that is loaded on the page. URL changes will result in a changed state of the application. Most importantly, client-side routing does not refresh the whole page. Generally, initial loading of client-side routed websites will be greater than server-side routed websites since we are loading the entire web-application at once.
