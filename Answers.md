_1._ Differences between client-side routing and server-side routing:
    A **client-side routing** happens when the route is handled internally by the Javascript that is loaded on the page. When a user clicks on the link, the URL will change, the adjustment or new component or some events will be rendered will result in a different view of the webpage.
    
    A **Server-side routing** causes the whole page to refresh. This is because a new **GET request** will be sent to the server, which discards the old page altogether and responds with a new document. 

_1._ Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - The plain text data that is sent between browser and the website.  Not a secure protocol.

_1._ CRUD - Create, Read ,Update, Delete. 
    
_1._ HTTP methods that we use when interfacing with servers/API's 
    Create - requires *PUT or POST* method.
    Read - requires *GET* method.
    Update - *PUT or POST* method.
    Delete - *DELETE* method.
 
_1._ I am guessing that Axios, react-router-dom, fetch are the tools we can use to make AJAX request.
