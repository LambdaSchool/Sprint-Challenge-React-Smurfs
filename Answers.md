1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
  Server side requests cause the whole page to refresh. A get request is sent to the server which
  responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page altogether.
  Client side, the whole page doesn't refresh, just the elements that need to. This is
  faster for obvious reasons.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
  Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

3.  What does CRUD stand for?
  Create Read Update Delete
  
4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
  C = Post, R = get, U = put, D = delete

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
  postman, fetch, axios
