1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
  * Server-side routing requests a new page, or document, from the server to serve to the user. This also causes the entire page to refresh.
  * Client-side routing uses internal routes to change the state of the application, change which data is showed (of which data is already stored client-side). This avoids the need of bringing in a whole new document and a page refresh.

2. What does HTTP stand for?
  * HyperText Transfer Protocol

3. What does CRUD stand for?
  * Create, Read, Update, Delete

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
  * PUT & Post - Create & Update
  * GET - Read
  * DELETE - Delete

5. Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.
  * [Axios] (https://github.com/axios/axios)
  * [Fetch API] (https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch)
  * [Request] (https://github.com/request/request)
