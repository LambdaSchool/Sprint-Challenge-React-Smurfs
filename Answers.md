1. Single source of truth is te structuring of information models and associated schemata such that every data element is stored exactly once. Redux/Application state is a storage of all the posibble states which will be used in an application. The stored states can be accessed by the various react components. The react component state is a state that is defined in a react component. This state can only be accessed and modified by the component where it is defined.
2. The Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to the redux store.  Action creators are functions that create actions. 
3. Reducers modify the stored states. They reference descriptions from the actions and actually apply changes.
4. HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete. They are the four basic functions of persistent storage. Create can be mapped with PUT/POST, read with GET, update with PUT/POST/PATCH and Delete with DELETE.
