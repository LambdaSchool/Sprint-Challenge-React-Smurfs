1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    1.  Server-side routing is the traditional form of routing and how most websites still work. When the URL is changed a request is made for a new page from the server, resulting in a page refresh and a new page being displayed. Client-side routing is handled locally in javascript. When the URL changes any updates are handled in state and no server request is made.
