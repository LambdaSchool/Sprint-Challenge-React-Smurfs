1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
From my understanding when someone clicks on a link the page will request a new page form the server, with server-side routing.
And with client-side routing same thing except when a user clicks a link the javascript handles the request and the request to the server is prevented.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, I memorized that from day one.

3.  What does CRUD stand for?
Create, Read, Update and delete, I havent memorized this one yet.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
From what I understand its 
Post = create
GET = Request
PUT = update
DELETE = delete

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
Well one we have been using recently is Axios and fetch, I dont know about the request one but I see its available.
