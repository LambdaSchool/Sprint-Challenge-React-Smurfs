1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client side routing is when the browser handles things; this usually doesn't result in a page refresh. Initial load times may be longer, but updates are faster and more fluid because

Browser side routing is when the server handles things; this usually does result in a page refresh. Initial load times are generally shorter, but updates take longer because the 
server has to send an entire new document to update the page.
