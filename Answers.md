1.  What does CRUD stand for?
1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
1.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

1)  Client side causes the url of the page to change but the whole page won't refresh. This can cause the intial load of the page to be slower. Server side routing requests a new page from the server so that every page causes a full page refresh.
2)  HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
3)  Create, Read, Update, delete.
4)  Create is the same as 'post'. Read is the same as 'get'. Update is the same as 'put'. Delete is the same as 'delete'.
5)  JQuery, Axios, Fetch API.
