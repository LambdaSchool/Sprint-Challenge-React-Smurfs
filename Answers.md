1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`. 

Server-side routing involves making a request to a server and then having the server retrieve the file and send the file
back to the client where the client renders the HTML/CSS. Each request causes a page refresh and needs to load each time a request is made. Now, with client-side routing, everything occurs in the browser and page refreshes are not needed for each request.
