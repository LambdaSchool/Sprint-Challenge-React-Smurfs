1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side routing requires a page reload each time in order to display new information that's been grabbed. This is because the server sends the full HTML file each time. In client-side routing, the server initially sends the HTML file, then only sends the JSON data required to update the page. Client-side routing tends to be faster and more user-friendly.
