1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    the server-side routing will request for the whole page to refresh and will route what is needed,
    while the  client-side routing route internally with the JS on the page and less data is being
    processed so its tends to be faster but the whole website would need to be louded first.
