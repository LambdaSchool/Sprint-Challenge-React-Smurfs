1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing is what happens when changing the url causes a request for an entirely new html document to be delivered from the web server, the remote host for the data that the web site is accessing. Client-side routing is when changes to the url make client-side changes to what appears in the browser window without making a request for a completely new HTML document from the server. Sometimes, certain information must be requested to complete even a client-side routing behavior, but instead of receiving a whole new page, the page is simply re-rendered by the browser using the specifically requested data.
