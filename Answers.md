1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Answer: A client-side routing doesn't send a request to the server, it happens when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is on the page. When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but the request to the server is prevented. Hence, the entire page is not refreshed.

A server-side request causes a new GET request. Hence, the whole page is  refreshed. The new GET request is sent to the server which responds with a new document, discarding the old page compltely.
