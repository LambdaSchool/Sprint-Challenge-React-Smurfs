1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
  In server side routing, a request is made to the server for a whole new page each time something happens within the page and the url changes. This discards the old page and brings up a whole new one. Client side routing, however, takes in the whole application on the first request, then all other routing requests are made client-side within the application, so the page doesn't refresh - it just dynamically displays elements to the screen depending on the url using JavaScript.
