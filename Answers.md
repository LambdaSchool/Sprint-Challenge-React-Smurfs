1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client side routing uses data available locally, limiting the need for requests to be sent to the server which conserves resources and improves performance. Server side routing uses data only accessible using a request to the server, meaning the client will only request data that is need from the server, but will need to send a new get request each time, which can decrease performance.
