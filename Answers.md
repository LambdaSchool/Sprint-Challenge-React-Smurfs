1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
A server side route happens when a user clicks on a link, and a whole new page is requested from the server, discarding the old page altogether. The entire page is refreshed to accomodate the new GET request sent to the server and the response with a new document.
A client side route happens when the route is handled internally by the webframework, or perhaps with a request to a server for some pieces of data that the web application will turn into HTML elements. The URL will change but most importantly there is no refreshing of the webpage. The adjustment to the URL is done with a change in the state of the web application.
