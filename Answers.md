1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
* I believe server-side routing involves making a Get request to an external server/API while client-side routing is handled in house 
so to speak and routes based on a server.js file.
1. What does HTTP stand for? 
* Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, basically the exchange between servers and browsers.
1. What does CRUD stand for? 
* Create, Read, Update, Delete.
1. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
* Post, Get, Put, Delete.
1. Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.
* I'm honestly not sure what this is asking.  Tools is a bit vague... I am not sure if this is referring to axios/react-router-dom/etc 
or something more like open/send/setRequestHeader.  We never used the latter (that I remember) so I'm guessing the former?  Well, honestly, 
I'm guessing neither is correct.  I'm sure I'll facepalm when I hear the answer...
