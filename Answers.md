1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    // With client-side routing, HTML is created at the browser by JavaScript, Less data and only what is requested will be processed; hence, it is always faster and quicker. It can also be  processed wherein the information/data is passed by the server during the initial load then the client-side perform the routing.

    With server-side routing, every time you go to a new URL, the entire page is refreshed on the server before it is sent to the client.  This process can alwo work in a way wherein when the page changes, the server feeds more information to the client. In this case, you'll need optimization and automation as mitigation techniques to enhance the speed and performance.  //
