<h1>Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing</h1>
<p>
    Client-side routing involves JavaScript to perform routing by storing state inside a web application. This is also known as state driven UI. For example, when a user interacts with an app JS prevents server-side routing and changes the internal state of the application. Client-side routing is generally faster than server-side routing, allows for robust UIs, but requires more setup with a longer initial render.

<p>
    Server-side routing is how sites traditionally function. This type of routing involves servers sending back data upon request. When data is returned, a full page refresh is performed even if that data only pertains to small portions of an app. One benefit of server-side routing is that only information that is requested. Another benefit is that sites using this type of routing are better opitimized for search engines. However server-side routing is susceptible to slow loading times especially when lots of data or requests are involved.
