1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    client side routing loads from the server just once and stores the whole website in local memory so that the side is faster after the initial load. It's great for customer experience, not as great for SEO.
    server-side loads each page from the server as the customer navigates. the initial load is faster, but each page the customer navigates has to pull from the server. it also results in better SEO.
