1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
        Client-side routing will send all data to the user when they first visit the page, even the sub-pages they have not yet visited.  Server-side routing will only send the user the data for that specific page they are on.  When a user switches pages, or interacts will specific parts of a page, client-side routing will only make the necessary changes, or load necessary components.  Server-side routing would send a brand new HTML file every time the user interacted with the page or switched pages.  There are pros and cons to both of these. Client-side would be slower up front, but much faster once loaded.
