1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

'Routing' refers to the act of navigating around a website. In this process, various blocks of code are accessed.  Routing can be managed in more than one way.  'Server-side' routing involves acessing the source files of the page and requires a full-page-refresh.  The GET request is sent to the server and a new page replaces the old page.  'Client-side' routing happens internally within the page and is handled by the JavaScript code that is loaded on the page.  The URL will change as a result of a change to the state of the object being manipulated.  This is beneficial in many settings since the users is able to change the content more seemlessly and without requiring a page-refresh. 


2.  What does HTTP stand for?

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.  It is essentially the standard of communication/common language of the web. 

I like this explanation from the training kit:

"HTTP Methods provide a common language or nomenclature that the client can use to let the server know what operation it wants to perform."


3.  What does CRUD stand for?

C: Create
R: Read
U: Update
D: Delete

CRUD represents the types of operations that can be done with server resources. 


4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

Use the POST method to ask the server to CREATE new resources. 

Use the PUT method to modify or UPDATE a specific resource. 

Use the DELETE method to REMOVE a resource. 

[get, post, put, delete, listen]

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, AJAX can use:

jQuery to write client-side JavaScript to navigate and manibulate a page.

JSON, another markup language used to define data (easier to use than XML).

Ajax Control Toolkit - a suite of controls integrated into Visual Studio that can be used for Ajax callbacks.
