1. Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

*  Client side routing allows for single page applications wherein all necessary HTML, CSS, and JS is accessed in the initial HTTP request, and page reloads are not necessary. Change occurs through AJAX wiht the server. Client side routing allows for the client side to have routes, such as with React Router, where different URL paths lead to differnet components of the app. Serve side routing involves making another HTTP request to the server to provide HTML, CSS, and JS for new aspects of the page.
