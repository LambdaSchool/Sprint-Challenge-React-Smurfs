1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side routing only requests data when it is needed. The initial load time is usually fairly fast but it does need to reload information from the server for each request. 
    On the other hand client-side routing loads the who SPA onto the clients device and than only uses the internal js to move from one page to another. The disadvantage it that the inicial load time can be significanly long. However, the pro is that once loaded the application is incredible fast since it does not need to fetch information from the server after each request for data.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
