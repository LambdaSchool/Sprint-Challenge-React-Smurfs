1. Client side routing is the impetus behind Single Page Applications. With client side routing, you get all of the information of the web page on initial arrival, and routing simply displays information you've already gathered. With server side routing, you retrieve the information you need each route, necessitating the refresh of the page every time.

2. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It's a web standard that facilitates the CRUD method.

3. The CRUD method stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. The CRUD method is a standard to which programs that store data are held. If they cannot do the four features described above, they are considered incomplete.

4. The analogous methods to CRUD that we are using with axios woulld be: .get(read), .post(create) , .put(update). and .delete(delete).

5. The way we have been making AJAX requests so far is through a promise-based client called axios. You can also use vanilla javascript with methods such as xhttp.open() and xhttp.send(). jQuery is another javascripy library that makes AJAX easier with tools like jQuery.get().
