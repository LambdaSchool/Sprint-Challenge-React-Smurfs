1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    `Client-side routing`: There are a lot of advantages with this, one main reason is that the page can render a lot more effeciently and quickly.  With this method the route is handled on the client's side and the entire page isn't refreshed.  Only some elements inside the app will change.
    `Server-side routing`:  It generally takes longer because every request made from a server causes the entire page to refresh.
