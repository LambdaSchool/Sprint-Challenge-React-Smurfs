1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing only requests the data that is needed each time, instead of requesting the entirety of the data like clinet-side routing. Server-side routing is considered the industry standard currently. Client-side routing requests all of the data from the server in the initial request and from there, the client-side handles any of the routing/rerendering of new elements. With client-side routing, the entire page does not refresh, only the necessary components do.
2.  What does HTTP stand for?
HyperText Transfer Protocol.
3.  What does CRUD stand for?
Create, Read, Update & Delete.
4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
Get, put, post and delete.
5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
The Fetch API, axios or another library like jQuery or Request. (This question isn't very clear to me, not sure if you're asking about methods or frameworks.) Methods would be 'put', 'post', 'delete'.
