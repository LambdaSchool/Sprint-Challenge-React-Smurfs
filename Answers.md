1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing involves refreshing the whole page because when a GET request is sent to the server it responds with a new document and discards the old page.  Whereas, client-side routing occurs when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page.  When a user clicks on a link, the URL changes but the request to the server is prevented and the url adjustment results in a changed state of the application.  The page won't refresh when using client-side routing.
