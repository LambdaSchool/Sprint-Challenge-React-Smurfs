1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh but it's better for SEO. A client-side route happens when the route is handled internally so it's generally faster and easier to implement. That said, on the first load, it will often take longer because it's loading the whole application.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

POST is the “C” in CRUD which stands for Create.
GET is the ‘R’ in CRUD which stands for read.
PUT is the “U” in CRUD and it stands for UPDATE
The DELETE HTTP request method is also the “D” in CRUD.

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
