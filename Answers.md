1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing occurs when there is some change made to the url that causes a new page to be requested from the server (GET). The server refreshes the page and displays the new page. With Client-side routing, the routing is done via the Javascript that is loaded on the page. The user makes a change to the page's state, and the new state is rendered to the user via Javascript voodoo. Client-Side routing does not require the entire page be refreshed when new data is requested.
