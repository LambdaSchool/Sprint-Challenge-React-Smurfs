Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

Server-side routing is when a full round trip is made to the server and client.  Example - Cliking on a link will send a request and a new page will be sent back (html document)

Client-side routing doesn't require a complete round trip to the server, instead for instance in a single page application no reloading is required.
