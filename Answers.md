1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing is when the client requests a website, the server gives back the HTML of the page that the client requested.  It's quicker initially than client-side routing is because in client-side routing when the initial request is made, the server returns the HTML of the website, the client makes an AJAX request, and the server responds with all of the Javascript on the website (even if it's not for the page the user is currently on).  So the initial loading time of a website being rendered with client-side routing is longer because it is gathering all of the information upfront, whereas in server-side routing, the client has to make specific requests for every user update.  In client-side routing, all of the data is already there to be used.

1.  What does HTTP stand for?

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol.

1.  What does CRUD stand for?

1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

We can use get for read, post for create, put for update, and delete for delete.

1.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

I do not understand this question.
I mean, AJAX itself is a tool?

.... do you mean methods?  Like, the methods that I just listed in the above question?
Do you mean promises?  That's only one thing.
Fetch API?  
Axios?
I don't know, I'm going to just stop trying to figure this out.
