1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing is process of navigating (routing) between pages (that which is displayed and interacted with) of a website by back/forth communication with a server.  Client-side routing (or single-page applications) is when that which is displayed and interacted with is loaded to the browser near entirely when the website first loads. Thus there is no need for back/forth communication with a server while a user is visiting the website.
