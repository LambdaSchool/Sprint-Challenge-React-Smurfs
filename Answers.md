1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side routing is when the routing is handled by JavaScript on the client. All the components are rendered and hidden based on paths. The data is already there and will be displayed when the correct paths are navigated to. The page won't have to completely refresh and only small changes are injected.
Whereas, server-side routing is where requests from the client are sent to the server and a response is sent back. Generally, the whole page refreshes once the data comes back. This process usually takes more time and not as favored compared to client-side routing.
