1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

`Server-side routing` is more traditionally done and causes and entire webpage to reload and refresh and takes longer to render.

As technologies have increased `client-side routing` has become more prominent. Since React builds state and thus a route internally, only the informaiton needed for a page can be requested and stored on state. Thus, a page does not need to refresh or reload when changes need to occur since everything loads initially.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is the way the web communicates (through hypertext connected through weblinks to nodes).

3.  What does CRUD stand for?

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete and refer to HTTP methods to communicate with servers. 

4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

The most common are GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE.

5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.

There are several libraries that can be used to make AJAX request such as `axios`, `jQuery $.ajax`,  and `Fetch API`.
