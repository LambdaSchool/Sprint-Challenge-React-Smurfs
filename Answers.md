1.  What does CRUD stand for?
1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
1.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

1. In server-side routing, when a request is made by the broswer for a new/adjusted URL (by clicking a link for a new page), the page refreshes and a new document is displayed. In client-side routing, requests result in a change in state internally and a different 'view' will be displayed, but it doesn't involve refreshing of the page or the displaying of an entirely new document. As a result, applications which use client-side routing are called single page applications.

2. HTTP stands for hyptertext transfer protocol.

3. CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete.

4. Create ==> GET, Read ==> POST, Update ==> PUT, Delete ==> DELETE

5. Request library, Fetch, and axios are some tools for making AJAX requests.
