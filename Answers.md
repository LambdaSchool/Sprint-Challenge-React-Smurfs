1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing occurs when a web-page requests a URL. The whole page refreshes because a new GET request was sent to the server.
The whole page will not refresh when using client-side routing.
Client-side routing happens when the route is made internally by javascript on the page. The change to the URL will result in a different view of the webpage, but not a whole new page.
