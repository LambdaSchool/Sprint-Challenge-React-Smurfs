1.  Server side routing gets a brand new html page for each url made and so always requires a refresh of the page while client side routing has 1 inital load time after
    which each view is easily swapped through. Because server side has been standard, it has been ompitimzed for in terms of speed so the intial load on the client side
    version might take a while, but once loaded, the experience on client side is much smoother. The load is larger as well since it loads all sections of that SPA which may
    include views the client may not even look at...
