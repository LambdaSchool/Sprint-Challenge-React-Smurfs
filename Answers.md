1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing sends only information you need but downloads and refreshes an entirely new webpage everytime you click on links.
Client-side routing loads everything at once, even something the user may not click on, but that also means it's faster in the long run since it doesn't have
to load everytime you click on a link.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol

3.  What does CRUD stand for?
