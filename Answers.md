1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Back in the days when everyone had AOL for email, pages were formed on the server and delivered whole. You only got the data for the page you were looking at. The prehistoric problem with that is a huge amount of data was redownloaded download between pages, For example, things like your header and footer, which is redundant and shouldn't need to be re-rendered again. Client-Side Routing, was the upgrade to gmail that we all needed.  With client-side routing you download a good chunk of the data for your whole site up front and then JavaScript in your browser switches between pages. It's not perfect, this does mean a longer time up front to view you page, but their is virtually no wait time switching between the pages on your site.
