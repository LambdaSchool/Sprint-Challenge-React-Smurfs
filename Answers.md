1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    Client-side routing loads multiple pages of content at once, resulting in a slower initial load, but faster transitions, and it can use re-used components (like common headers and footers) repeatedly without re-loading them. Server-side routing loads each time the page content changes, including re-loading common content, but avoids loading things that the user may or may not ever navigate to.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?

    HyperText Transfer Protocol -- the rules of how information should be sent between different computers on the Web.

1.  What does CRUD stand for?

    Create, Read, Update, Delete -- the four operations that can be made on external data.

1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

    Create <-> POST
    Read <-> GET
    Update <-> PUT
    Delete <-> DELETE

1.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests

    The fetch method, axios, and ... the request library? I don't remember us talking in class about a third one.
