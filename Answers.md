1.  With routing, a user can click on links and navigate a website. On a server a link that user clicks on sends a request to the server and a new document is delivered to the user. This refreshes the whole page and discards the old data on the page which is not optimal although browsers have been optimized for them over time. On client-side requests, javascrip code handles routing in such a way that components or functions/ objects return html elements as requested. The initial load in this case is a bit longer. A combination or smart decision on either is necessary.

2.  HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol.

3.  CRUD is an acronym for create, read, update, and delete.

4.  POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE http methods can be mapped to create, read, update/ replace, partial update/ modify, delete CRUD methods respectively to interact with the API on hand. With axios, these methods can retrieve and update information to a server for example.

5.  Axios, Fetch API, and jQuery are useful tools for creating requests to the server.
