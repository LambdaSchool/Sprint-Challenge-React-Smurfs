1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    --Server-side routing is when a site/app gets or updates data for a page by requesting that data from the server. This is done by a whole document getting sent and forcing a refresh each time, even when only a single component of the page needed to update. Client-side routing is handled internally by the JS that is loaded on the page, which updates the data or state of the application but only for what needed to be updated. This means a slightly longer inital load time, but a much faster transition between pages/sections.
