1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side routing
    - A new document is requested every time, reloading the entire page.
    - A con is that the entire page will refresh even with the slightest bit of change.

Client-side routing

- Client gets one HTML file on initial request. A full page refresh is not necessary because the JavaScript will only re-render parts of the UI that changed
- The downside is that the initial request takes longer and the user may not need all the files to use the app.
