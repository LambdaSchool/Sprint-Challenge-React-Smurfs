1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Server-side routing is when new pages are sent from the server and the page will refresh every time
you click on a new link. Client-side routing is when new pages are sent from the JavaScript loaded
on the page. Everything loads at the beginning so it is slower to initially open the website, but all routes
are faster after that.
