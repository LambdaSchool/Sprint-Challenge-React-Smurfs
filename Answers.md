1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    server-side-routing has been the standard for a long time and is considered the traditional page lifecycle. When a web URL request comes through it is handled server side ...this means there are stores of complex and weird template HTML files on the server as it has to render a new file every time a change is made. 

    Client side routing is what happens when you take full desktop functionality and you put it in a browser. There might be many languages involved, but the HTML is simpler, compiling is done on the client side ...which means the page renders only renders what is necessary. No refresh every time a post is made to your Facebook wall!
