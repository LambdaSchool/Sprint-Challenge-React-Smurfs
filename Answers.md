1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
  `Client-side routing` manages the data for the application within its own memory, along with API requests when additional data is needed, keeping the need for page re-rendering down.
  `Server-side routing` requests and manages all of its data from a server. This means that each time we navigate to a new URL, a fresh page is loaded into the server.
