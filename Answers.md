1. Server-side routing is when you navigate to a new page and the entire DOM refreshes due to a new GET request serving you the new document. Client-side routing, however, is when you cause the page to submit and changes occur, but only a few aspects of the DOM refresh due to JS.

2. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. If you add a 's' to it, like HTTPS, it adds a SSL to it which increases the security. I never link anything without that 's'!

3. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete, the four major functions of HTTP when altering data from a database (API in our case, I believe).

4. List below:
---
1. Create
 - PUT / POST
* Read
 - GET
* Update
 - PUT / POST
* Delete
 - DELETE

5. Axios, xhr, fetch and request are all used to process AJAX data.
