1.  What does CRUD stand for?
1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

    This yields better SEO, but it creates a delay for the user each time they navigate around the site.
    In client-side routing the entire site is sent initially, hence the term single-page app.  Building such sites
    is a bit more work for the developer and the initial load-time is slightly longer, but once the site is loaded the user can navigate the site seamlessly without the browser ever needing to refresh.
2.  Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol
3.  Create, Read, Update, Delete
4.  Respectively:  Post, Get, Put, Delete
