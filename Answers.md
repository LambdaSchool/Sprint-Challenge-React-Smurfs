1.  Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

Client-side routing occurs when the route is handled internally by JS and his loaded to the page. When a link is clicked, the URL will change, but there is no request sent to the server. What does change is the state of the component/application, and only the pieces that need to change will change. The entire page will not reload.

Server-side routing occurs a user clicks on a link, a request is sent to the server, and a new document is sent back from the server. The entire page will refresh in this case.
