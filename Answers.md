1.  What does CRUD stand for?
1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

### 1. The main difference bwteen client side routing and server side routing is that server side routing results in full page request and refreshes as each request goes to the server. However, it will only request the data that is needed. While client side routing the entire app is loaded on the first request resulting in faster load times once loaded, but slower initial load times.

### 2. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which is the protocol used by the world wide web.

### 3. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete which are the four basic functions of persistent storage.

### 4. Create is used by Post, Read is used with Get, Delete is used with delete, and update is used with PUT
