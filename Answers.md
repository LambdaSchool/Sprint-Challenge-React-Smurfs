1. Client-side routing updates the url using javascript, and conditionally renders pre-loaded components based on the current path. Server-side routing executes an http request in response to changes in the browser url and the server responds appropriately based on the path. Client-side routing is much faster because http requests are slow in comparison to a DOM reflow.

2. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol

3. CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete

4. Create: POST, Read: GET, Update: PUT, Delete: DELETE

5. Three tools which can make AJAX requests are the axios library, the jquery library, and the `fetch` function built in to later versions of javascript.
