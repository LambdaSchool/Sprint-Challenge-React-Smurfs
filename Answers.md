1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

1. Client side routing is usually a single-page app where the client makes a single request to the server. The entire page is sent to the client. The client at this point generally has all they 
need. Unless a database is accessed, they wont typically make any more calls to the server. Server-side routing is when most of the work is being done on the server. The client makes a request
to the server for every action that they take. The advantage to Server-side routing is that the page will open up quicker since the initial download is going to be smaller. The advantage to
the client-side routing comes after the page is loaded. Almost everything at this point is handled on the clients computer so there is a major performance advantage.
