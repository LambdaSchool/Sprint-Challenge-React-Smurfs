1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server-side-routing is navigation that occurs on the server side. Clicking on a link or navigating the page will cause the server to serve up an entirely new page. Client-sound-routing is when all of the information from the server is loaded once, but the navigation and page setup occurs on the client side. Clicking a link will cause different components/information to render, but the information isn't new from the server. It is just displayed or moved.
