1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    *  A client-side route happens when the route is handled internally by the JavaScript that is loaded on the page.
    * A server-side request causes the whole page to refresh. This is because a new GET request is sent to the server which responds with a new document, completely discarding the old page altogether.

2.  What does HTTP stand for?
     * HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). HTTP is a means by which to get data from a server. HTTP is the set of rules for transferring files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the World Wide Web.
