1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.
The terms are literal definitions of what they are; client-side-routing is when the routing happens inside the client itself (internally).
I.E. if I click a link in my own app, my app will redirect me to a page that Imade inside of my app. Server-side routing does this, but handles it but via a server/ datatbase outside of the client.

2. What does HTTP stand for?
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It transfers hypertext requests between applications and servers.

3. What does CRUD stand for?
It stands for creat, retrieve, update, and delete. We are currently using axios to implement CRUD.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
I am guessing this means, how do we communicate to the database. I am guessing ```axios.get```, ```axios.post```, ```axios.put```, and ```axios.delete```, and promises such as ```then```, and ```catch```.

5. Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.
Is that what I mentioned above? Like our, get.json? Delete and post?
