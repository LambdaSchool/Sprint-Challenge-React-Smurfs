1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server side routing requires the entire page refresh. This makes for a quicker initial load time,
    however causes there to be more load times between pages.
    Client side routing requires that all of the potential data be requested at the start making for a
    longer initial load time, however load times after the fact for different pages don't require more
    server calls and doesn't require the page refresh, so those load times are quicker since the information is already there.
