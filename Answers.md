1. Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

Server-side routing is more like a traditional website, where the application runs on the client and anytime data is required, the client asks the server to download it. 

In client-side routing, the client asks the server for the entire application and all its data up front. Then, the client runs the app locally without having to download any further data. It best for situations where there is a need to minimize Internet activity, but it doesnâ€™t help much, and may be worse, for data volumes. 

2. What does HTTP stand for?

It stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It is the set of rules that govern how and why applications work on the Internet.

3. What does CRUD stand for?

Create, Read, Update, Destroy

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

Create (Post) , Read (Get) , Update (Put) , Destroy (Delete) 

5. Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.

Axios and Fetch are the only two libraries that we learned about for this, as I recall, but a quick search found others: Request, JQuery, and something called SuperAgent, which just sounds awesome.
