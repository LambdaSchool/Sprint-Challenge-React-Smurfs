1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

With server-side routing it initially gives you only the data you need and refreshes the page on each update sending back an entire new HTML document. Client side is loaded fully on the initial page load so you do not need to load additional data whilist navigating. Everything should then feel snappy. Client side is more work to set up and not as great with SEO/Google Crawling but they are making strides. Server side was the standard for a long time.
