1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    The difference between client-side routing and server-side routing is the way information is rendered
    and displayed. Client-side routing has to do with rendering the entire website on the initial request. This
    form of routing also changes the elements on the page when the URL changes. Server-side routing on the other hand
    changes the page entirely when the link changes, through GET requests, this form of routing disregards the old page
    and presents a new page entirely. This is also considered a quicker form of routing because it will be faster to load a single
    page in the website than the entirety of the website.
