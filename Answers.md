## 1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
* client side routing happens when the clients browser handles the rendering of pages, everything is also rendered all at once when loading into the page as oppposed to the server side routing where the server only hands the browser what needs to be loaded which means it takes less time to load the front page of a browser when first entering but will be slower than a client side router after it needs to access a sub page.

## 2.  What does HTTP stand for?
*  Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

## 3. What does CRUD stand for?

## 4. 1.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
* Read = GET
* Create = POST
* Update = PUT
* Delte = Delete

## 5. Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests.
* the axios API.
* an XMLHttpRequest Object that is created when setting up axios to send or recieve data asynchronously.
