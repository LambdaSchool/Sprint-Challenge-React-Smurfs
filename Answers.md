--Explain the differences between client-side routing and server-side routing.

+ Server side routing allows for a whole new page or update to be served to the user when a link is clicked, etc. A GET request is usually sent to server which then in turn sends back a new page and deletes the old page. 

+ Client side routing involves a route handle internally via JavaScript. Adjustments in URL result in a changed state of the app. This altered state will result in a different webpage view. Rendering new components, etc. happen on this side. The whole page does not refresh, only what needs to be refreshed.
